## :pencil2: Worksheets
You can find the worksheets for every tutorial in the respective folder 'x-tutorial-date/worksheet'.
They consits out of analytic (hand-written) and programming exercises. The exercises should be worked through **before** the tutorial. There are exercises which are covered in the tutorial and task which are for studying at home (marked with a house symbol). Questions on both types of tasks are answered in the tutorial and **all tasks are relevant for the exam**.
## :notebook: Notebooks
For all the programming exercises you can find jupyter-notebooks with **additional hints** in 'x-tutorial-date/notebooks'.
It is not compulsory to make the exercises in a jupyter-notebook but it might be helpful to look at them if you are stucked
to check out the hints.
You can also convert the jupyter-notebooks to a python script using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
```
$ conda install nbconvert
```
And then convert the jupyter-notebook to a python script with
```
$ jupyter nbconvert --to script  NAME_NOTEBOOK.ipynb

```
